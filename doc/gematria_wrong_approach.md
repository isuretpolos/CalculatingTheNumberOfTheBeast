I completely reject Gematria as an approach to calculating the number of the Beast for the following reasons:

- The number 666 is the result of a calculation, not the starting point.
- Gematria is never used anywhere in the Bible.
- The number 144,000 itself is calculated in Revelation 7:4–8 through a simple multiplication of 12 × 12,000.
- The calculation must ultimately reflect the same symbolism as the final result, 666, namely "absolute imperfection on all levels."
- The number refers to the Beast with ten horns, representing a coalition of nations, not a single individual.
- The symbolism of the number must be considered in its broader context, not in isolation. Therefore, one must particularly include Revelation chapters 12 to 14 to better understand the context.
