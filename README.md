# Calculating the Number of the Beast

````bible
Here is wisdom. He that hath understanding, let him count the number of the beast; for it is the number of a man: and his number is 666.
(Revelation 13:18)
````

## Introduction

Revelation 13:18 presents a challenge. This verse does not merely state the number 666 but invites the reader to *calculate* it (Greek: *psephisatō*, from *psephizō*, meaning to compute or reckon, often with pebbles as in ancient arithmetic). **The Bible does not provide a detailed, step-by-step formula for calculating 666, as it does for the 144,000 (12 × 12,000) in Revelation 7:4-8, but instead calls on the reader to discover the method themselves**.

The Greek word used for “calculate” (psephisatō, from psephizō) implies a deliberate computational process, suggesting that **there is an intended method to arrive at 666**, though the text does not explicitly outline it. 

In modern words:

> The number I have calculated is 666. You, as the reader, know the symbolism of the number and the broader context. Now, figure out how to calculate it. Additionally, I provide in the context the number 144,000, which I have previously pre-calculated with a very simple multiplication (12 tribes × 12,000 = 144,000, symbolizing divine perfection). I have also symbolically repeatedly brought before your eyes how great the difference between perfection and imperfection is, similar to how Ecclesiastes (the Preacher) illustrates it in 1:15: "That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered."

If we view the text of Revelation as a puzzle for the reader to solve—with hints on symbolism, context, and adjacent numbers like 144,000—then the described arithmetic formula could indeed be the **"to-be-discovered" calculation**. The author (traditionally John) does not just present 666 as a finished number but explicitly calls for calculation ("Let the one who has understanding calculate the number of the beast"), implying a logical path that a wise reader can uncover. **The proximity to 144,000 in Revelation 14:1 (just one verse later) and the repeated symbolism of perfection (e.g., through multiplications like 12 × 12 × 1,000 for the redeemed) versus imperfection (6 as the human number, tripled) underscores this**. Similar to **Ecclesiastes 1:15 ("What is lacking cannot be counted")**, the "deficiency" is thematized, which could justify the subtraction (e.g., of **144 as a symbol for a "day" of deficiency**, drawing on 2 Peter 3:8).


## Gematria is the Wrong Approach

I completely reject Gematria as an approach to calculating the number of the Beast for the following reasons:

- The number 666 is the result of a calculation, not the starting point.
- Gematria is never used anywhere in the Bible.
- The number 144,000 itself is calculated in Revelation 7:4–8 through a simple multiplication of 12 × 12,000.
- The calculation must ultimately reflect the same symbolism as the final result, 666, namely "absolute imperfection on all levels."
- The number refers to the Beast with ten horns, representing a coalition of nations, not a single individual.
- The symbolism of the number must be considered in its broader context, not in isolation. Therefore, one must particularly include Revelation chapters 12 to 14 to better understand the context.

The common interpretation of 666 as gematria (numerical value of letters, e.g., “Nero Caesar” in Hebrew transliteration = 666) is problematic because it ignores the audience, historical context, and symbolism of Revelation. Revelation was addressed to Greek-speaking Christians in Asia Minor (e.g., Ephesus, Smyrna; Rev. 1:4, 11), who were not primarily familiar with Hebrew gematria. Gematria was a Jewish/Greco-Roman practice but not common among early Christians for biblical exegesis.

### Audience and Familiarity with Hebrew Gematria
The readers were primarily Gentile Christian communities in the Roman province of Asia, who spoke Greek and read the NT in Greek. Hebrew gematria (Mispar Gadol) required knowledge of the Hebrew alphabet and transliteration (e.g., “Nron Qsr” for Nero). Many early Christians did not know Hebrew; the Septuagint (Greek Bible translation) was standard. To recognize 666 as “Nero,” readers would need to transliterate Nero’s name into Hebrew—a complex step most would not know. Jewish texts like the Sibylline Oracles used gematria, but this was obscure and not mainstream for Christians. Revelation emphasizes symbolic wisdom (“Let him who has understanding calculate”), not linguistic puzzles.

### Evidence Against Nero as the “Beast”
The Nero theory (Nero redivivus myth: Nero as a returning tyrant) does not fit seamlessly. First: In Greek gematria, “Nero Caesar” yields 1005, not 666—only the Hebrew variant (without the vowel “e”) works, which feels contrived. Second: The beast in Rev. 13 has 7 heads and 10 horns (symbolizing a global empire, cf. Daniel 7), which exceeds Nero (merely one emperor among many). The “fatal wound” (Rev. 13:3) is healed, suggesting an enduring system, not Nero’s suicide in 68 CE. Third: If the beast were Nero, the prophecy would have failed—the harvest in Rev. 14 (post-beast) has not occurred, implying a 2000-year “gap” that undermines the apocalyptic urgency. Instead, 666 symbolizes a human system of imperfection (“the number of a man”).

Overall, the symbolic, arithmetic interpretation (without gematria) better aligns with the biblical message, as it is universally accessible and emphasizes contrasts with perfection (144,000). Gematria (assigning numerical values to letters) is not used elsewhere in the Bible and would be inaccessible to the Greek-speaking audience without Hebrew knowledge. The Greek *psephizō* points to pebble-based reckoning, fitting this simple subtraction and division.

## Full Process of Calculation

1) **666 is the result of an arithmetic calculation**, not the base for gematria or a numerological number puzzle. The Greek word used for "calculate" in Revelation 13:18 is ψηφισάτω (psephisatō), which comes from the root ψηφίζω (psephizō). This word has a double meaning for mathematical calculation: counting/computing with pebbles (like an abacus) and also decision-making through voting by casting pebbles into urns to make choices.

2) The number is a **symbolic name** pointing toward human beings, 10 horns, and 7 heads. In a broader sense, it represents a political system formed by the Devil himself as a consequence of his defeat in the war in heaven (Revelation 12 + 13), which is the Wild Beast (wild = untamable).

3) **Understanding** in the symbolic language of the Bible is necessary, along with the wider context, so include chapter 14 of Revelation as well.

4) **Wisdom** also means to act according to the insight or understanding—not to meddle with politics and to remain politically neutral until the White Horse has finished his ride in chapter 20.

5) **Chapter 7 of Revelation** reveals that 144,000 is "calculated" or counted, with 12 × 12,000 = 144,000.

````math
12 × 12,000 = 144,000
````

6) Both numbers, 666 and 144,000, are contrary to each other in their symbolic meaning. 666 means absolute imperfection, and 144,000 means absolute perfection in conjunction with heaven's organization. The Wild Beast is in contrast to the Lamb and his followers. The number 144,000 resides in the same context of the number 666, just one verse later in Revelation 14:1.

7) Ecclesiastes chapter 1 gives us a clue: what is lacking cannot be counted. The entire book of Ecclesiastes talks about the perfect eternal cycles of nature and the vanity of imperfect human beings seeking to gain fame in this old system. This contrast is similar to Revelation chapters 13 and 14, where both numbers are put in comparison.

````bible
That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.
(Ecclesiastes 1:15)
````

The clue here is that the calculation involves a **subtraction**.

8) The multiplication of 12 × 12 indicates that the calculation of the Number of the Beast (666) involves a symbolic number as well. The number itself reveals what it is: **6**.

9) To understand how much we need to subtract from 144,000, let's consider what Peter said about a day in the eyes of God:

````bible
But forget not this one thing, beloved, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
(2 Peter 3:8)
````

And in contrast to it:

````bible
And Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.
(Genesis 2:16-17)
````

Adam and Eve did not die within the same 24-hour day, but within a day of 1,000 years. Adam lived 930 years, Methuselah 969 years—all less than 1,000. So the **subtraction** is at least 1/1,000 of 144,000.

10) The calculation and the result both have highly significant symbolic value. Indeed, both are equal in their symbolism, which means the calculation symbolizes absolute imperfection and the number symbolizes absolute imperfection. The arithmetic calculation needs to be correct.

It is a closed-ended mathematical operation grounded in symbolism: Start with the perfect number 144,000 (symbol for divine completeness), subtract a symbolic deficiency (144, as 1/1,000 of 144,000, interpreted as "one day" of shortfall based on 2 Peter 3:8), and then divide three times by 6 (for the triple imperfection of the beast, contrasting with 777 as divine trinity).

Here are the steps in detail, including how to arrive at the solution:

1. **Starting Point: 144,000**  
   This number is drawn from Revelation 7:4 and 14:1, computed as \(12\) (tribes of Israel) × \(12\) (apostles or completeness) × \(1,000\) (fullness or universality). Simple multiplication: \(12 \times 12 = 144\), then \(144 \times 1,000 = 144,000\). It symbolizes the complete multitude of the redeemed.

2. **Subtraction of the Deficiency: 144,000 - 144 = 143,856**  
   144 is chosen as the symbolic shortfall (from Ecclesiastes and the "thousand years as one day" metaphor in 2 Peter 3:8, linked to human imperfection in Genesis, where Adam lived less than 1,000 years). Subtract: \(144,000 - 144 = 143,856\). This represents the transition from perfection to imperfection.

3. **First Division by 6: 143,856 ÷ 6 = 23,976**  
   Divide by 6 (symbol for humanity and its limitations, as man was created on the sixth day). Arithmetic: \(143,856 \div 6 = 23,976\).

We see here another highly symbolic number lacking 1/1,000: the number 24,000.

4. **Second Division by 6: 23,976 ÷ 6 = 3,996**  
   Repeat the division: \(23,976 \div 6 = 3,996\). This amplifies the symbolism of imperfection.

Again, at each level it lacks 1/1,000.

5. **Third Division by 6: 3,996 ÷ 6 = 666**  
   Final division: \(3,996 \div 6 = 666\). The solution is 666, achieved through this sequential operation. You arrive at it by applying the symbolism (perfection minus deficiency, then triple-divided by imperfection) arithmetically.

This reading makes Revelation more interactive and engaging for the reader, as if John is saying: "You know the numbers and symbols—compute it!" It is a strong complement to classical gematria and emphasizes biblical unity.

# The Use of “Psephisatō” in Other Ancient Texts

The word “psephisatō” (aorist imperative of psephizō, ψηφίζω) is used in Revelation 13:18 and translated as “calculate” or “compute.” The mathematical nuance dominates in contextual usage, reinforcing “psephisatō” as a call for an arithmetic operation (not just counting or understanding).

## Classical Greek (e.g., Polybius and Plutarch)
Psephizō is often used for “calculating” or “estimating,” typically with pebbles as a computational tool. Polybius (Histories, ca. 150 BCE) uses it in Book 6 for tallying votes in assemblies, but implicitly arithmetically (counting and adding pebbles). Plutarch (Moralia) describes it as “compute” in financial contexts, e.g., estimating costs—similar to Luke 14:28 (NT: “calculate the cost”). This shows it goes beyond mere counting and includes operations like addition/subtraction.

## Mathematical Context in Antiquity
Greeks used “psephoi” (pebbles) for calculations on counting boards (e.g., Salamis Tablet, ca. 300 BCE), a precursor to the abacus. Aristotle (Politics) mentions psephizō in the sense of “computing” numbers in economics. Herodotus (Histories) uses related forms for “calculating” distances or quantities, implying a true mathematical operation, not just enumerative counting.

## Difference from “Counting/Understanding”
While the voting meaning (e.g., in Thucydides: casting pebbles for decisions) is metaphorical, the computational meaning prevails in technical texts. In the NT (outside Revelation), Luke 14:28 says: “Sit down and calculate (psephisai) the cost”—here, it involves subtraction/division of resources, not simple counting. Lexicons like Liddell-Scott-Jones confirm: primarily “compute by counters,” secondarily “vote.” In Revelation 13:18, it thus calls for a deliberate arithmetic process, fitting the subtraction and division described in the text.

# Former Approaches to Discovering the Formula

The absence of a specific formula in Revelation 13:18 has led to various interpretive approaches to “calculate” the number 666, each reflecting different ways readers have sought to uncover the method:

## Gematria (Numerical Value of Names)

Historically, one of the most common methods for interpreting the number 666 is [gematria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gematria), a Jewish and early Christian practice where letters of an alphabet (e.g., Hebrew or Greek) are assigned numerical values, and the sum of a name’s letters yields a number. Revelation 13:18’s phrase “it is the number of a man” suggests that 666 could represent a person’s name.

Example: The name “Neron Caesar” (in Hebrew: נרון קסר) sums to 666:

Nun (נ) = 50, Resh (ר) = 200, Waw (ו) = 6, Nun (נ) = 50, Qoph (ק) = 100, Samekh (ס) = 60, Resh (ר) = 200.

Total: 50 + 200 + 6 + 50 + 100 + 60 + 200 = 666.

Early church fathers like [Irenaeus (2nd century)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irenaeus) explored this method, proposing names like “Lateinos” (for the Roman Empire) or “Teitan,” but cautioned against definitive conclusions due to the ambiguity of multiple names summing to 666.

## Symbolic Interpretation Without Calculation

Some scholars and theologians argue that the call to “calculate” is less about a literal mathematical formula and more about discerning the symbolic meaning of 666.

## Modern Interpretations

In modern times, some have proposed creative or speculative methods, such as linking 666 to numerical patterns in technology (e.g., barcodes or digital systems), though these often lack biblical grounding.

# Historical and Contextual Clues

The historical context of Revelation, likely written during the late 1st century under Roman persecution, suggests that the number 666 could point to a figure or system of that era, such as Emperor Nero or the Roman Empire. However, the prophecy described in Revelation 12–13, which details the cosmic battle involving the dragon, the woman, and the beast, was not yet fulfilled during the time of its writing. These chapters are widely understood by many scholars to refer to future eschatological events, likely tied to the end times, rather than events unfolding in the immediate context of the late 1st century. This future-oriented nature of the prophecy could mislead early readers into assuming that gematria—a common method of assigning numerical values to letters to decode names—would be sufficient to identify a specific person or entity living in their own time, such as a contemporary ruler or figure like Nero. While gematria was a familiar practice in Jewish and early Christian circles, applying it to pinpoint a living individual might oversimplify the prophecy’s broader scope, which may encompass a system, ideology, or figure yet to emerge.

Readers in the original context might have been tempted to use gematria or contextual knowledge to identify the referent of 666, given its cultural prevalence and the immediate pressures of Roman persecution. For example, the Hebrew spelling of “Neron Caesar” (נרון קסר) sums to 666, making Nero a plausible candidate in the minds of early Christians familiar with his persecution of the church. However, the unfulfilled nature of the prophecy suggests that the beast and its number may point to a reality beyond the 1st century, potentially leading to misinterpretations if readers focused solely on contemporary figures.

The method for calculating the number could also involve recognizing patterns in Revelation’s vivid imagery, such as the beast’s “seven heads and ten horns” (Revelation 13:1), which symbolize authority, power, and opposition to God. These symbols might inform the calculation symbolically or contextually, pointing not just to a single person but to a broader system or coalition of powers that would only fully manifest in the future. Thus, while gematria offers a compelling tool for decoding the number 666, the prophetic context of Revelation 12–13 warns against limiting its interpretation to a person or entity present at the time of writing, encouraging readers to seek wisdom in discerning its ultimate fulfillment.
