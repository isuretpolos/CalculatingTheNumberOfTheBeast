# Calculating the Number of the Beast
## Full Process of Calculation

````bible
Here is wisdom. He that hath understanding, let him count the number of the beast; for it is the number of a man: and his number is Six hundred and sixty and six.
(Revelation 13:18)
````

1) **[666 is the result of an arithmetic calculation](calculate_the_number_of_the_wild_beast.py)**, not the base for [gematria](doc/gematria_wrong_approach.md) or a numerological number puzzle. The Greek word used for "calculate" in Revelation 13:18 is ψηφισάτω (psephisatō), which comes from the root ψηφίζω (psephizō). This word has a double meaning for mathematical calculation: counting/computing with pebbles (like an abacus) and also decision-making through voting by casting pebbles into urns to make choices.

2) The number is a **symbolic name** pointing toward human beings, 10 horns, and 7 heads. In a broader sense, it represents a political system formed by the Devil himself as a consequence of his defeat in the war in heaven (Revelation 12 + 13), which is the Wild Beast (wild = untamable).

3) **Understanding** in the symbolic language of the Bible is necessary, along with the wider context, so include chapter 14 of Revelation as well.

4) **Wisdom** also means to act according to the insight or understanding—not to meddle with politics and to remain politically neutral until the White Horse has finished his ride in chapter 20.

5) **Chapter 7 of Revelation** reveals that 144,000 is "calculated" or counted, with 12 × 12,000 = 144,000.

````math
12 × 12,000 = 144,000
````

6) Both numbers, 666 and 144,000, are contrary to each other in their symbolic meaning. 666 means absolute imperfection, and 144,000 means absolute perfection in conjunction with heaven's organization. The Wild Beast is in contrast to the Lamb and his followers.

7) Ecclesiastes chapter 1 gives us a clue: what is lacking cannot be counted. The entire book of Ecclesiastes talks about the perfect eternal cycles of nature and the vanity of imperfect human beings seeking to gain fame in this old system. This contrast is similar to Revelation chapters 13 and 14, where both numbers are put in comparison.

````bible
That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.
(Ecclesiastes 1:15)
````

The clue here is that the calculation involves a **subtraction**.

8) The multiplication of 12 × 12 indicates that the calculation of the Number of the Beast (666) involves a symbolic number as well. The number itself reveals what it is: **6**.

9) To understand how much we need to subtract from 144,000, let's consider what Peter said about a day in the eyes of God:

````bible
But forget not this one thing, beloved, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
(2 Peter 3:8)
````

And in contrast to it:

````bible
And Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.
(Genesis 2:16-17)
````

Adam and Eve did not die within the same 24-hour day, but within a day of 1,000 years. Adam lived 930 years, Methuselah 969 years—all less than 1,000. So the **subtraction** is at least 1/1,000 of 144,000.

10) The calculation and the result both have highly significant symbolic value. Indeed, both are equal in their symbolism, which means the calculation symbolizes absolute imperfection and the number symbolizes absolute imperfection. The arithmetic calculation needs to be correct.

Subtract from the perfect number 144,000 one thousandth of it, which is 144:

````math
144,000 - 144 = 143,856
````

Then divide it three times by 6, an imperfect number:

````math
143,856 ÷ 6 = 23,976
````

We see here another highly symbolic number lacking 1/1,000: the number 24,000.

````math
23,976 ÷ 6 = 3,996
````

Again, at each level it lacks 1/1,000.

````math
3,996 ÷ 6 = 666
````
