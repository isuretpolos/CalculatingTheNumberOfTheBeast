# Calculating the Number of the Beast

````bible
Here is wisdom. He that hath understanding, let him count the number of the beast; for it is the number of a man: and his number is Six hundred and sixty and six.
(Revelation 13:18)
````

The Bible does not provide a detailed, step-by-step formula for calculating the number 666 in Revelation 13:18, as it does for the 144,000 (12 × 12,000) in Revelation 7:4-8, **but instead calls on the reader to discover the method themselves**!

To expand on this, Revelation 13:18 states: “This calls for wisdom. Let the one who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundred sixty-six.” The Greek word used for “calculate” (psephisatō, from psephizō) implies a deliberate computational process, suggesting that **there is an intended method to arrive at 666**, though the text does not explicitly outline it as it does for the 144,000 in Revelation 7:4-8, where the formula is clearly given as 12 tribes × 12,000 = 144,000.

## Gematria is the wrong approach

I completely reject Gematria as an approach to calculating the number of the Beast for the following reasons:

- The number 666 is the result of a calculation, not the starting point.
- Gematria is never used anywhere in the Bible.
- The number 144,000 itself is calculated in Revelation 7:4–8 through a simple multiplication of 12 × 12,000.
- The calculation must ultimately reflect the same symbolism as the final result, 666, namely "absolute imperfection on all levels."
- The number refers to the Beast with ten horns, representing a coalition of nations, not a single individual.
- The symbolism of the number must be considered in its broader context, not in isolation. Therefore, one must particularly include Revelation chapters 12 to 14 to better understand the context.

## Full Process of Calculation

1) **[666 is the result of an arithmetic calculation](calculate_the_number_of_the_wild_beast.py)**, not the base for gematria or a numerological number puzzle. The Greek word used for "calculate" in Revelation 13:18 is ψηφισάτω (psephisatō), which comes from the root ψηφίζω (psephizō). This word has a double meaning for mathematical calculation: counting/computing with pebbles (like an abacus) and also decision-making through voting by casting pebbles into urns to make choices.

2) The number is a **symbolic name** pointing toward human beings, 10 horns, and 7 heads. In a broader sense, it represents a political system formed by the Devil himself as a consequence of his defeat in the war in heaven (Revelation 12 + 13), which is the Wild Beast (wild = untamable).

3) **Understanding** in the symbolic language of the Bible is necessary, along with the wider context, so include chapter 14 of Revelation as well.

4) **Wisdom** also means to act according to the insight or understanding—not to meddle with politics and to remain politically neutral until the White Horse has finished his ride in chapter 20.

5) **Chapter 7 of Revelation** reveals that 144,000 is "calculated" or counted, with 12 × 12,000 = 144,000.

````math
12 × 12,000 = 144,000
````

6) Both numbers, 666 and 144,000, are contrary to each other in their symbolic meaning. 666 means absolute imperfection, and 144,000 means absolute perfection in conjunction with heaven's organization. The Wild Beast is in contrast to the Lamb and his followers.

7) Ecclesiastes chapter 1 gives us a clue: what is lacking cannot be counted. The entire book of Ecclesiastes talks about the perfect eternal cycles of nature and the vanity of imperfect human beings seeking to gain fame in this old system. This contrast is similar to Revelation chapters 13 and 14, where both numbers are put in comparison.

````bible
That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.
(Ecclesiastes 1:15)
````

The clue here is that the calculation involves a **subtraction**.

8) The multiplication of 12 × 12 indicates that the calculation of the Number of the Beast (666) involves a symbolic number as well. The number itself reveals what it is: **6**.

9) To understand how much we need to subtract from 144,000, let's consider what Peter said about a day in the eyes of God:

````bible
But forget not this one thing, beloved, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
(2 Peter 3:8)
````

And in contrast to it:

````bible
And Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.
(Genesis 2:16-17)
````

Adam and Eve did not die within the same 24-hour day, but within a day of 1,000 years. Adam lived 930 years, Methuselah 969 years—all less than 1,000. So the **subtraction** is at least 1/1,000 of 144,000.

10) The calculation and the result both have highly significant symbolic value. Indeed, both are equal in their symbolism, which means the calculation symbolizes absolute imperfection and the number symbolizes absolute imperfection. The arithmetic calculation needs to be correct.

Subtract from the perfect number 144,000 one thousandth of it, which is 144:

````math
144,000 - 144 = 143,856
````

Then divide it three times by 6, an imperfect number:

````math
143,856 ÷ 6 = 23,976
````

We see here another highly symbolic number lacking 1/1,000: the number 24,000.

````math
23,976 ÷ 6 = 3,996
````

Again, at each level it lacks 1/1,000.

````math
3,996 ÷ 6 = 666
````


# Former approaches to Discovering the Formula
The absence of a specific formula in Revelation 13:18 has led to various interpretive approaches to “calculate” the number 666, each reflecting different ways readers have sought to uncover the method:

## Gematria (Numerical Value of Names)

Historically, one of the most common methods for interpreting the number 666 is [gematria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gematria), a Jewish and early Christian practice where letters of an alphabet (e.g., Hebrew or Greek) are assigned numerical values, and the sum of a name’s letters yields a number. Revelation 13:18’s phrase “it is the number of a man” suggests that 666 could represent a person’s name.
Example: The name “Neron Caesar” (in Hebrew: נרון קסר) sums to 666:

Nun (נ) = 50, Resh (ר) = 200, Waw (ו) = 6, Nun (נ) = 50, Qoph (ק) = 100, Samekh (ס) = 60, Resh (ר) = 200.

Total: 50 + 200 + 6 + 50 + 100 + 60 + 200 = 666.

Early church fathers like [Irenaeus (2nd century)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irenaeus) explored this method, proposing names like “Lateinos” (for the Roman Empire) or “Teitan,” but cautioned against definitive conclusions due to the ambiguity of multiple names summing to 666.

## Symbolic Interpretation Without Calculation

Some scholars and theologians argue that the call to “calculate” is less about a literal mathematical formula and more about discerning the symbolic meaning of 666.

## Modern Interpretations

In modern times, some have proposed creative or speculative methods, such as linking 666 to numerical patterns in technology (e.g., barcodes or digital systems), though these often lack biblical grounding.

# Historical and Contextual Clues

The historical context of Revelation, likely written during the late 1st century under Roman persecution, suggests that the number 666 could point to a figure or system of that era, such as Emperor Nero or the Roman Empire. However, the prophecy described in Revelation 12–13, which details the cosmic battle involving the dragon, the woman, and the beast, was not yet fulfilled during the time of its writing. These chapters are widely understood by many scholars to refer to future eschatological events, likely tied to the end times, rather than events unfolding in the immediate context of the late 1st century. This future-oriented nature of the prophecy could mislead early readers into assuming that gematria—a common method of assigning numerical values to letters to decode names—would be sufficient to identify a specific person or entity living in their own time, such as a contemporary ruler or figure like Nero. While gematria was a familiar practice in Jewish and early Christian circles, applying it to pinpoint a living individual might oversimplify the prophecy’s broader scope, which may encompass a system, ideology, or figure yet to emerge.
Readers in the original context might have been tempted to use gematria or contextual knowledge to identify the referent of 666, given its cultural prevalence and the immediate pressures of Roman persecution. For example, the Hebrew spelling of “Neron Caesar” (נרון קסר) sums to 666, making Nero a plausible candidate in the minds of early Christians familiar with his persecution of the church. However, the unfulfilled nature of the prophecy suggests that the beast and its number may point to a reality beyond the 1st century, potentially leading to misinterpretations if readers focused solely on contemporary figures.
The method for calculating the number could also involve recognizing patterns in Revelation’s vivid imagery, such as the beast’s “seven heads and ten horns” (Revelation 13:1), which symbolize authority, power, and opposition to God. These symbols might inform the calculation symbolically or contextually, pointing not just to a single person but to a broader system or coalition of powers that would only fully manifest in the future. Thus, while gematria offers a compelling tool for decoding the number 666, the prophetic context of Revelation 12–13 warns against limiting its interpretation to a person or entity present at the time of writing, encouraging readers to seek wisdom in discerning its ultimate fulfillment.
