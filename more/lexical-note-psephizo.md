> In Rev 13:18, *psephisatō* (aor. impv. of *psephizō*) calls the reader to **reckon**—the ancient practice of computing with counters/pebbles. It implies a **concrete arithmetic process** (cf. Lk 14:28 “calculate the cost”), not letter-value puzzles. The verb’s nuance fits subtraction and division rather than gematric encoding.
