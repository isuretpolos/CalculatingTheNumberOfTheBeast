# 6 + 1 = 7 — Completion Through Rest

`6 + 1 = 7` is more than arithmetic; it is a pattern of completion. In Scripture, **six** marks human labor and limitation, while the **one** that follows supplies what is lacking—Sabbath rest, renewal, and wholeness. 

The creation week (six days of work plus the seventh day of rest) shows that without the seventh, the cycle is unfinished; exertion is not consolidated and strength is not restored. 

Thus the **one** perfects the **six**: the week becomes whole, work receives meaning, and imperfection is brought to completion. 

**Arithmetically and symbolically the parts are equivalent**: the deficiency of six is answered by one, yielding **seven**—a sign of perfection.
