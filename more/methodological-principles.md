> # Methodological Principles
>
> 1. **Scripture interprets Scripture:** Prefer internal arithmetic (e.g., 12×12×1,000) over external ciphers.
> 2. **Symbol before speculation:** Numerical meaning must match the final result’s symbolism.
> 3. **Audience accessibility:** Explanations should be computable by Greek-speaking believers without Hebrew codes.
> 4. **Consistency of scale:** Use the same symbolic scale across steps (e.g., the “one-day” deficit as 1/1,000).
> 5. **Transparency:** Every step should be verifiable with simple arithmetic.
