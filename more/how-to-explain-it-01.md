A man begins to read the Book of Revelation. When he reaches chapter 13, verse 18 captures his attention:
*“Let the one who has insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. That number is 666.”*

He notices that 666 is a triple six — an imperfect number repeated three times. Curious, he multiplies 666 by 6 and gets 3,996. Nothing seems remarkable at first glance. He continues reading.

In chapter 14, verse 1, he comes across another number: 144,000. A thought arises — could these two numbers be related?

Driven by intuition, he multiplies 3,996 again by 6. The result: 23,976. Interesting. It falls just 24 short of 24,000 — exactly 1/1,000 less.

He multiplies once more by 6 and obtains 143,856 — again, just 144 short of 144,000. A pattern is emerging. In all three multiplications, the result falls short by exactly one-thousandth of the "complete" number.

Suddenly, he recalls a passage from the Book of Daniel, chapter 5:
*“TEKEL – you have been weighed on the scales and found wanting.”*

And from Ecclesiastes:
*“What is lacking cannot be counted.”*

A realization dawns. The number 666 is more than just a symbol — it is a measure, a weight, a name. It represents the Wild Beast: a force that seeks to replace God’s Kingdom, demanding worship in the same way Satan desires to be worshipped.

But it falls short — always lacking, always incomplete.
