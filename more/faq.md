> **Q1: Isn’t this eisegesis?**
>
> **A:** No. The arithmetic is drawn from Revelation’s own numbers (12, 144, 1,000) and the explicit command to “calculate.”

> **Q2: Why not Gematria?**
>
> **A:** It’s not taught in Scripture, is audience-inaccessible, and produces unstable results (e.g., 616/1005 variants).

> **Q3: Why divisions by six?**
>
> **A:** Six marks human limitation; threefold repetition intensifies imperfection, matching 666’s symbolism.

### What exactly is “wisdom” in Revelation 13:18, in light of Job 28:28, Proverbs 9:10, and Psalm 111:10?

**Answer:** In Scripture, **wisdom begins with the fear of Jehovah God**—a reverent alignment with God’s ways (Job 28:28; Prov 9:10; Ps 111:10). Applied to Rev 13:18, “let the one who has understanding calculate” means: use a **God-aligned method** that stays inside Scripture’s own symbolic arithmetic (e.g., 12×12×1,000; the triple six), not speculative codes imported from outside. Wisdom here is **moral-spiritual discernment leading to right method**, not clever cipher hunting.

**Key texts:** Job 28:28; Proverbs 9:10; Psalm 111:10.

### Why is Nero’s death in 68 CE decisive against the Nero–gematria reading, and how does this relate to the dating of Revelation?

**Answer:** The Nero reading requires 666 to identify **one past emperor** and his alleged return. But **Nero died in 68 CE** by suicide; Revelation’s Beast sustains a **healed, world-impacting “wound”** that persists into the climactic harvest of Rev 14—events not fulfilled in the first century. With the **traditional late date** for Revelation (c. 95 CE), the timing further weakens Nero-specific readings. Even for an early date, the text’s **scope and sequence** exceed Nero’s lifetime. The gematria solution therefore **mismatches both symbolism and chronology**.

**Key texts:** Rev 13:3,14; Rev 14; historical date of Nero’s death (68 CE).

### How does Jerusalem’s destruction in 70 CE display the rejection of the Jewish system, and why does that exclude Hebrew gematria as a method?

**Answer:** The **Temple’s destruction (70 CE)** publicly signaled the end of the old administration; the new covenantal community was now **predominantly Greek-speaking**. Employing **Hebrew gematria** as the key to Revelation would **re-center a superseded framework** and **obscure** the message for its intended audience. Revelation’s own arithmetic (12, 144, 1,000) is **transparent and universal**, whereas Hebrew letter-value ciphers would be **esoteric** for Gentile congregations.

**Key themes:** Matt 23:38; Heb 8:13; audience accessibility.

### What biblical examples show Christians speaking plainly about political powers rather than using secret codes like gematria?

**Answer:** Scripture models **clear, open witness**:

* **John the Baptist** rebuked Herod openly (Luke 3:19).
* **Jesus** called Herod “that fox” (Luke 13:32) and exposed hypocrisy without ciphers.
* **Peter and the apostles**: “We must obey God rather than men” (Acts 5:29).
* **Paul** reasoned frankly before Felix, Festus, Agrippa (Acts 24–26).
  Revelation itself **depicts and denounces** imperial idolatry symbolically yet plainly (Rev 17–18), without requiring letter-value puzzles.

### What do you mean by “multiple levels” in Revelation pointing to the same message, and why does gematria produce tarot-like ambiguity?

**Answer:** Revelation integrates **coherent layers**:

1. **Symbolic** (beasts, horns, heads),
2. **Canonical** (Danielic echoes),
3. **Liturgical/ethical** (call to endurance and holiness),
4. **Eschatological** (final judgment and harvest).
   These layers **converge** on one message: **contrast between divine perfection and human/systemic imperfection**. **Gematria** tends to be **under-determined** (many names fit 666/616), yielding **multiple incompatible candidates**—a **tarot-like multivalence** that **dilutes** Revelation’s unified warning.

### What other biblical verses or principles support the arithmetic method (e.g., subtraction for “lack” and dividing by six) to reach 666?

**Answer:**

* **Deficiency motif (subtraction):** “What is lacking cannot be counted” (Eccl 1:15); “weighed… and found wanting” (Dan 5:27); “all have sinned and **fall short**” (Rom 3:23).
* **Divine ‘day’ scale (1,000):** “With the Lord one day is as a thousand years” (2 Pet 3:8), illuminating the **1/1000 shortfall**.
* **Six and triple intensification:** **Sixth day** (humanity; Gen 1:26–31); **triple** as intensifier (cf. “holy, holy, holy” Isa 6:3; “woe, woe, woe” Rev 8:13). Thus **threefold six** = **absolute imperfection**.
* **Explicit biblical arithmetic:** **12×12×1,000 = 144,000** (Rev 7:4; 14:1), providing the **perfection baseline** from which the calculation proceeds.

### Why is the arithmetic method “wiser” than gematria, and how does it help Christians today apply the warning about the Beast?

**Answer:** It is “wiser” because it **submits to Scripture’s own grammar of numbers**, is **accessible** to the original audience, and **aligns method with meaning** (the steps and the result both signal **defect → intensifying imperfection**). For today’s believers, this clarity **shapes discernment**: beware **systems** that demand worship, normalize deceit, and promise salvation without God. The arithmetic method keeps the focus on **moral allegiance and endurance** (Rev 13:10; 14:12), not on chasing ever-changing name ciphers.
