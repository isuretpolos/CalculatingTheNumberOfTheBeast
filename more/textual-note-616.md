> # Textual Note: 616 Variant
>
> A minority tradition records **616** instead of **666**. The variant is often explained by name-based readings (e.g., altered transliterations). Our approach does not depend on such readings: it rests on Revelationâ€™s **internal arithmetic** and **symbolic framework**, which remain coherent regardless of the 616 variant.
